simple estimation of ai data center power and SMR requirement
# AI Data Center & SMR Power Simulation

This project explores the relationship between large-scale AI data centers and Small Modular Reactors (SMRs).

It estimates:
- Total AI server power demand
- How many SMRs required to supply that power

The models show how the rapid expansion of AI infrastructure could drive demand for stable, carbon-free energy sources such as SMRs.
